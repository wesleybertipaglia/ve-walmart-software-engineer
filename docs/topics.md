# Topics

The Walmart Software Engineering job simulation covers the following topics:

## Data Structures
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are essential for solving complex problems and building efficient algorithms. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are essential for developing efficient software solutions and optimizing performance. Some common algorithms include sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.

## Software Engineering
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It involves applying engineering principles and practices to build high-quality software products. Some key concepts in software engineering include requirements analysis, design patterns, testing, and version control.

## System Architecture
System architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, including its components, interactions, and design principles. It is essential for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems. Some common system architecture patterns include monolithic, microservices, and serverless architectures.

## Optimization
Optimization involves improving the performance, efficiency, and scalability of software systems. It is essential for building high-performance applications and reducing resource consumption. Some common optimization techniques include algorithmic optimization, code optimization, and database optimization.

## Data Munging
Data munging is the process of cleaning, transforming, and analyzing raw data to extract useful information. It is essential for preparing data for analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Some common data munging techniques include data cleaning, data wrangling, and feature engineering.

## Java
Java is a popular programming language used for building enterprise applications, web services, and mobile applications. It is known for its portability, performance, and scalability. Some key features of Java include object-oriented programming, platform independence, and automatic memory management.

## Python
Python is a versatile programming language used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. Some key features of Python include dynamic typing, list comprehensions, and functional programming.

## Relational Databases (SQL)
Relational databases are a way of storing and managing structured data using tables, rows, and columns. They are essential for building data-driven applications and performing complex queries. Some common relational database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

## UML
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized modeling language used for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems. It is essential for communicating design ideas, analyzing system requirements, and validating software architectures. Some common UML diagrams include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams.
