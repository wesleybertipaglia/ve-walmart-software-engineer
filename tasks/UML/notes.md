# Notes for the Software Architecture task

## Key Concepts

### Class Diagrams

- **Class Diagrams** are a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

- **UML** (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. The standard is managed, and was created by, the Object Management Group.

- **UML Class Diagrams** are the main building blocks of any object-oriented solution. It shows the classes in a system, attributes, and operations of each class and the relationship between each class.

### Software Architecture

- **Software Architecture** is the process of converting software characteristics such as flexibility, scalability, feasibility, reusability, and security into a structured solution that meets the technical and the business expectations.

- **UML Class Diagrams** are a key part of software architecture. They help to visualize the structure of a system and the relationships between classes.

- **Design Principles** are fundamental concepts that are used to guide software design. They are often used to help developers design software that is easy to maintain and extend over time.

- **Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates that can be applied to different situations to solve a problem.
